# Hash_Table

This code was mainly written from the YouTube channel "Jacob Sorber". 
I merely copied the code while adjusting parameters to make sense of what was happening as well as "clean" it up.
The video that this code was written from can be found here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ti5yvumFTU

This respository has two different files. "hash.c" is the code I copied from Jacob's channel to make sense of linear probing, as well as updated the code with adjustments I saw would make more sense logically. The second file - "hashex.c" - is an extension of the first in that I replaced the linear probing method by using linked lists. This effectively creates more space with the small hash table I used.
